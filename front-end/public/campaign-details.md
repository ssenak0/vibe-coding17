## Campaign Overview

Young people are facing a growing mental health crisis. Long waitlists, limited in-person services, and stigma make it hard to ask for help—especially in moments of acute stress. The Youth Mental Health Crisis Center will provide an immediate, accessible, and anonymous first line of support.

Our platform will offer:
- Anonymous chat with trained volunteers for real-time, empathetic listening and guidance.
- A curated directory of crisis hotlines and local resources, searchable by location and need.
- A real-time counselor availability tracker so youth can see when licensed professionals are online and how to reach them quickly.

Built with privacy, security, and accessibility in mind, the center is designed to meet young people where they are—on their phones—so they can find help without fear or friction.

## Funding Goal Breakdown ($50,000 USD)

- $25,000: Platform Development & Security (secure chat, resource database, availability tracker, monitoring)
- $15,000: Counselor & Volunteer Onboarding/Training (recruitment, training stipends, supervision)
- $10,000: Outreach & Awareness Campaign (social media, school partnerships, youth ambassadors)

## Timeline

- Month 1: Core platform development and volunteer recruitment.
- Month 2: Beta launch and initial user feedback.
- Month 3: Public launch and start of outreach campaigns.

## Impact Statement
